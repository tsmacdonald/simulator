				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p>Welcome to UniSIM. This program provides the user with a blank slate (a grid), and all the tools that he or she needs to populate that grid with "agents," which can be anything from a rabbit in a predator-prey simulation, to "alive" squares in Conway's Game of Life. In addition, the user can specify interactions between these objects, called "triggers," and the outcome of those interactions ("behaviors"). Ultimately, this provides the user with a sandbox to create almost any interaction possible for a grid-based system.	</p>

				<p><a id="beginsim"></a></p>

				<h1>Beginning a Simulation</h1>

				<p>When you start the UniSIM, you have 2 choices. You can either start from scratch and create a new simulation, or you can load one of the pre-existing simulations from a file. When you start from scratch you need to specify a simulation name and the height and width values for the simulation grid. When loading a file, ensure that the format is correct for the Universal Simulator.</p>

				<p>There are a few files bundled with the program to give you an example of how to create a working simulation. These include "Conway's Game of Life" and "Rock Paper Scissors." If the user doesn't want to load one of these, that's fine; they can simply create a blank simulation to populate themselves.</p>

				<p><a id="general"></a></p>

				<h1>General</h1>

				<p>After the user has loaded or created a new simulation, they are presented with the main screen. The user can view the grid, and modify some general things about how the simulation runs.</p>

				<p>First of all, the user can modify the simulation name, the width of the grid, and the height of the grid. Note that changing the height and width will cause some "clipping" of agents which would be out of bounds in the new grid.</p>

				<p>The user can also change the step delay, the update type, and the time limit from this screen.</p>

				<p>Step delay: The time (in milliseconds) between each simulation step. This will determine how fast a simulation unfolds, both on screen and off.</p>

				<p>Update type: In order to increase the options for users, we've added an update type, which determines how each iteration in the simulation is run. Different update methods are suited for different scenarios; it's up to the user to decide which to use.
					<ul>
						<li>Linear: For each iteration, each grid agent will be looked at, one at a time, to determine which actions it will perform, then the agent will do those actions. The order in which those actions are performed is based on trigger priority (see below). Note that agents that get in line earlier for acting could have an impact on what later agents do, because they could change the state of the grid.</li>
						<li>Atomic: For each iteration, each agent finds out what it will do, before any agent action is taken. Then, it take that action, after every agent has figured out what it will do. This fixes the issue with an agent at the front of the line modifying what a later agent will do, but it creates another problem: What if fish 1 has decided it wants to eat fish 2, and fish 2 has decided it wants to eat fish 1? Under this system, they will eat each other. This is obviously not a good update method if that situation could arise.</li>
						<li>Priority: Priority updating contrasts with linear updating. In linear updating, each agent is looked at, then each trigger priority is looked at. In priority updating, however, the priority is considered first. Let's look at an example. Consider a grid with two agents, A1 and A2. Suppose A1 has 2 Triggers, T1 and T2, with priority(T1) = 3 and priority(T2) = 5. Now, suppose A2 has 1 trigger, T3, with priority(T3) = 2. The order in which the simulation checks the triggers would then be, T3, T1, T2. If this scenario was run with linear updating, though, the order would be T1, T2, T3, since it looks at the first agent (A1), goes down the priority list, then looks at the next agent (A2).</li></p>
					</ul>
				<p>Time limit: The total number of steps to run the simulation before it is halted.</p>

				<p><a id="agentcreation"></a></p>

				<h1>Agent Creation</h1>

				<p>Agents are the main actors in the grid, and as such, care must be taken when creating types of agents. UniSIM has a useful wizard for doing just that. Note that using this wizard creates an <strong>agent type</strong>, not an agent, so that the user can add any number of instances (agents) of this agent type to the grid. At any time, the user can modify any of the agent's values. Take note, though, that modifying something could cause another part of the simulation to stop working. In this case, the simulation will notify the user of the offending change.</p>

				<p>On the first screen, there are three main options for the user:</p>

				<p>Agent Name: How this type of agent will be known. This is important later, with triggers (which decide how agents will interact with each other by name). The user should have a good knowledge of the agents' names that he or she has chosen.</p>

				<p>Icon: Here, the user can select different pixels of the Agent's icon to display. This creates a unique, user changeable way to identify the agent on the grid.</p>

				<p>Color: The user can choose the base color for this agent.</p>

				<p>Note that fields and triggers should be added to each <b>agent type</b> as well (see below). Once an <b>agent type</b> has been created, new instances of that agent can be added to the grid. To add an instance of an agent to the grid, the user can simply go to the "Agent" tab and select the agent type that he or she would like to add. Then, the user can click on the grid slot to add that agent at that position. Clicking on a slot with an existing agent will first delete that agent, then clicking again will add the chosen agent.</b>

				<p><a id="fields"></a></p>

				<h2>Fields</h2>

				<p>After visual effects are taken care of, some technical data must be collected on the next page. Here, the user can add fields to the agent, which are values that each agent of that agent type will hold. Examples include "weight" or "isPoisoned." And number of fields can be added. Simply click "Add Field" to add another row</p>

				<p>Field Name: The identifier for this field. It's important for triggers, as they need a way to identify agents' different fields.</p>

				<p>Initial Value: The default, starting value for each agent created of this type. Note that any kind of value may be used here (such as "hello" or "5"), but it is up to the user to ensure that these are used appropriately (adding 2 to hello obviously doesn't make much sense). This is important, since triggers can have complex, user-defined expressions, which won't be able to evaluate properly in the case that the user has incorrect field values. The simulation will notify the user if an expression like this cannot be evaluated, so that the user can correct the issue.</p>

				<p><a id="triggers"></a></p>

				<h2>Triggers</h2>

				<p>Lastly, the user can add triggers to the agent. These determine how an agent will act, and are thus essential for the simulation. Simply click the "Add Trigger" button to add a new trigger to the list. You'll then be presented with our trigger builder interface.</p>

				<p>Name: The name of the trigger to make.</p>

				<p>Priority: A simple integer value, which determines how all of the triggers for a specific agent are ordered. The first trigger with conditions that evaluate to true will fire, along with all triggers sharing the same priority (for example, if an agent had three triggers, call them T1, T2, and T3, with priority(T1) = priority(T2) = 3 and priority(T3) = 5, and if evaluate(T1) = evaluate(T3) = true, then, going down the list of triggers, T1 comes first, since it has a lower priority, and T1 and T2 would both fire, since they have the same priority).</p>

				<p>If: The "if" part of an "if..., then..." clause. If the condition expression evaluates to true, then the trigger will fire (assuming it has the lowest priority of all "true" triggers). Here, the user has liberty to choose between many different types of input. This also means that the user must be <b>extra careful</b> to avoid problems with expressions that don't make sense.
					<ul>
						<li>Fields: The user can retrieve values of fields from the agent to which this trigger belongs. This can be done using the "Add conditional" button.</li>
						<li>Literals: The user can enter literal values, such as "100" or "27.3." This can be done by clicking the "Add Text" button.</li>
						<li>Operations: The user can choose between any number of three kinds of operations, done using the "Add Conditional" button:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Boolean -> Boolean Operations: Operations that take two true/false values (on the left and right) and evaluate to a true/false expression (AND, OR, NOT).</li>
							<li>Literal -> Boolean Operations: Operations which take literals (on the left and right), but evaluate to true/false (>, &lt;, >=, &lt;=, EQUALS, NOT_EQUALS)</li>
							<li>Literal -> Literal Operations: Take literals (on the left and right) and evaluate to literals (+, -, *, /).</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Built-in functions: We've included a set of built-in functions to make the user's life easier. Formatting for the functions works much like mathematical notation (also found in most programming languages). Let's look at an example: get_field_of_agent_at (see this function below for a description of what it does). In mathematical notation, we have functions like f(x) = x^2 + 2 or f(x, y) = x * y. If we consider "get_field_of_agent_at" in this paradigm, we get soemthing like get_field_of_agent_at(x-val, y-val, field-name). Just as f(x) takes an input value (for x) and spits out an output, get_field_of_agent_at takes three input values (x-val, y-val, and field-name) and spits out an output, in this case the value of the field. It will take some time for the user to get used to this way of expressing functions if he or she has not seen it yet before. That's why we've added helpful values in the drop-down boxes (like left-parenthesis, right-parenthesis, and comma), so most of this is simply selecting something from a drop-down.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>True: Simply evaulates to true, no matter the circumstances.</li>
							<li>is_slot_open: Checks to see if the slot entered is empty of any agents. The formatting should be drop-down("is_slot_open") + drop-down("(") + x-value + drop-down(",") + y-value + drop-down(")"). This will produce something like "is_slot_open(x-value, y-value)" creating the valid syntax for a function call.</li>
							<li>is_valid_coord: Checks to see if the coordinate entered is valid. Any coordinate within the bounds of the grid is considered valid. The formatting should be drop-down("is_valid_coord") + drop-down("(") + x-coord + drop-down(",") + y-coord + drop-down(")").</li>
							<li>get_global_field: Retreives a global field's value with the given name. It should be formatted as follows: drop-down("get_global_field") + drop-down("(") + field-name + drop-down(")").</li>
							<li>get_field_of_agent_at: Retrieves the given field of an agent at the specified x, y coordinate, if it exists. It should be formatted as follows: drop-down("get_field_of_agent_at") + drop-down("(") + x-value + drop-down(",") + y-value + drop-down(",") + field-name + drop-down(")").</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				If you find you've made a mistake when making the trigger conditional expression, simply click the "delete conditional" button. That will remove the last value added.</p>
					
				<p>Caveat: Anything which is a text value (as opposed to a numerical value), such as a field's name, should be surrounded by '. So, for example, you'd have to type in 'weight' (with single quotes), not weight (without single quotes).</p>
					
				<p>Then: The "then" part of an "if..., then..." clause. This is the outcome or consequence of the condition expression evaluating to true. We've included a list of behaviors that the user can choose, such as "die," "moveRandom," and "setFieldOfOther." Note that any behavior that takes an argument (for example, setFieldOfOther takes two arguments, one for the name of the field, and one for the new value) can include an expression in that argument (See "If" above for a summary of valid expressions). This also includes <b>all the built-in functions valid from the "If" clause.</b> For example, if you wanted to increment the weight of a fox that just ate a rabbit, you could say something like set_field("weight", weight + 1). As with "If," we've included a list of behavior functions:
					<ul>
						<li>clone_prototype: Makes a new agent at the given x, y coordinate from the prototype (the agent type)--this ensures that the new agent will have all default values. It should be formatted as follows: drop-down("clone_prototype") + drop-down("(") + x-pos + drop-down(",") + y-pos + drop-down(")").</li>
						<li>clone: Makes a new agent at the given x, y coordinate, copying this agent's field values over to the clone. It should be formatted as follows: drop-down("clone") + drop-down("(") + x-pos + drop-down(",") + y-pos + drop-down(")").</li>
						<li>move_left: Moves the agent left a specified number of slots, if possible. An agent in the path does not block this agent's movement; this agent passes through. However, an agent at the destination position blocks movement. It should be formatted as follows: drop-down("move_left") + drop-down("(") + spaces-to-move + drop-down(")").</li>
						<li>move_right: Moves the agent right a specified number of slots, if possible. An agent in the path does not block this agent's movement; this agent passes through. However, an agent at the destination position blocks movement. It should be formatted as follows: drop-down("move_right") + drop-down("(") + spaces-to-move + drop-down(")").</li>
						<li>move_up: Moves the agent up a specified number of slots, if possible. An agent in the path does not block this agent's movement; this agent passes through. However, an agent at the destination position blocks movement. It should be formatted as follows: drop-down("move_up") + drop-down("(") + spaces-to-move + drop-down(")").</li>
						<li>move_down: Moves the agent down a specified number of slots, if possible. An agent in the path does not block this agent's movement; this agent passes through. However, an agent at the destination position blocks movement. It should be formatted as follows: drop-down("move_down") + drop-down("(") + spaces-to-move + drop-down(")").</li>
						<li>kill: Kills the agent at the given grid slot, if it exists. It should be formatted as follows: drop-down("kill") + drop-down("(") + x-slot + drop-down(",") + y-slot + drop-down(")").</li>
						<li>die: Causes this calling agent to die.</li>
						<li>clone_agent_at_position: Clones the <b>prototype version</b> of the agent at the given grid slot, if possible. This new copy will have default values for fields, since it was copied from the <b>prototype, or agent type</b> The new clone is created at the second given coordinate. It should be formatted as follows: drop-down("clone_agent_at") + drop-down("(") + old-x-pos + drop-down(",") + old-y-pos + drop-down(",") + new-x-pos + drop-down(",") + new-y-pos + drop-down(")").</li>
						<li>set_field_of_agent_at: Sets a field of the agent at the given grid slot, if possible. It should be formatted as follows: drop-down("set_field_of_agent_at") + drop-down("(") + x-slot + drop-down(",") + y-slot + drop-down(",") + field-name + drop-down(",") + new-field-value + drop-down(")")</li>
						<li>set_field: Sets the field of this calling agent. It should be formatted as follows: drop-down("set_field") + drop-down("(") + field-name + drop-down(",") + new-field-value + drop-down(")").</li>
					</ul>
				Again, if you've found you made a mistake, simply click "delete behavior."</p>

				<p><a id="layers"></a></p>

				<h1>Layers</h1>

				<p>Layers provide the user with the opportunity to see the simulation unfold from many different angles. The user can simply select a specific agent, and a field from that agent, and the display will change to take on a "graded" appearance determined by values of that field in each specific grid spot. The layer color can be determined by the user For example, if I wanted to view the grid based on the "age" field of a "fox," every slot without a fox would be black, whereas every slot with a fox would be graded in color based off of how much that fox weighs. Suppose that there are only two foxes in the grid. Call them F1 and F2. If weight(F1) = 10 and weight(F2) = 25, F2's grid spot would be the color chosen, whereas F1's grid spot would be about 2/3 of the way between the chosen color and black; the rest of the grid would be entirely black.</p>

				<p><a id="globalfields"></a></p>

				<h1>Global Fields</h1>

				<p>Global fields act very much like agent fields. The global fields list is a place where the user should add any field like "humidity" or "gravity" that's applicable to every grid space in the simulation grid. </p>

				<p><a id="stats"></a></p>

				<h1>Statistics</h1>

				<p>Statistics are accessible from the main screen with the "Statistics" button. Users can view statistics about the average field value of a type of agent, the average lifespan of a type of agent, and the population of a particular type of agent over time.</p>
